    "# Detecting cheaters in Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or CS:GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive)\n",
    "is a competitive multiplayer first\n",
    "person shooter game developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. Since\n",
    "published in 2012, CS:GO sells over 25 millions copies while continues to be\n",
    "one of the most-played game in the world. However, one issue that always\n",
    "plague the game since release: cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cheaters uses a variety of techniques/programs to gain an unfair advantage.\n",
    "Machine learning algorithm can detect these anomalies very well. In fact,\n",
    "Valve is currently using a deep learning neural net called [VACnet](https://www.pcgamer.com/vacnet-csgo/).\n",
    "We will attempt to build a similar neural net but at a much smaller scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will apply machine learning to detect cheaters in CS:GO. The algorithm\n",
    "will give a probability of the player is a cheater based on his lifetime in-game\n",
    "performance and some characteristics of the steam profile. If the probability\n",
    "is high, replays should be reviewed by other players to determine the player's\n",
    "legitimacy. The result should not be used for banning players. Banning a legitimate\n",
    "player means losing a paying customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, steam platform which hosts CS:GO provides an API which makes collecting data\n",
    "much easier. Registered Steam users are identified by a unique Steam ID, \n",
    "which can be used to retrieve public player information, in-game metrics, \n",
    "and instances of bans due to cheating detected by Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC).\n",
    "VAC banned status will become the label where True represents cheater and\n",
    "False represents non-cheater.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get a list of steam IDs that contains both cheaters and non-cheaters?\n",
    "Steam does not have that list (at least publicly). One approach would be crawling\n",
    "multiple lists of steam users who play CS:GO and hope for the best.\n",
    "However, most players are not cheaters and thus, this simply takes too much\n",
    "time.\n",
    "The other approach is much more elegant. Steam communities has built many websites\n",
    "to check if a player is VAC banned in the past. For this project, [VACBanned.com](http://www.vacbanned.com/)\n",
    "and [VAClist.net](https://vaclist.net/) will be used. If a player is suspicious in game,\n",
    "other players can search him on these websites for his VAC status. Thus, the steam IDs\n",
    "from these website will contain more true cheaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining a list of steam IDs, each is passed through four API calls for data collection:\n",
    "1. [GetPlayerSummaries](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerSummaries_.28v0002.29)\n",
    "    - communityvisibilitystate that flags if a profile is private or public.\n",
    "    - If private: no statistics available, skip to next steam ID.\n",
    "    - If public: continue to the next call.\n",
    "2. [GetOwnedGames](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetOwnedGames_.28v0001.29)\n",
    "    - playtime forever: a less experienced player who performs too well\n",
    "    is suspicious.\n",
    "    - playtime last 2 weeks: helps labeling. If an account is VAC banned from CS:GO,\n",
    "    they cannot play CS:GO again. Thus, if playtime last 2 weeks is greater than 1, change\n",
    "    the label to False.\n",
    "    - number of games owned: a player is less likely to cheat if he has multiple games (purchased\n",
    "    with money) in his library.\n",
    "3. [GetPlayerBans](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetPlayerBans_.28v1.29)\n",
    "    - VAC banned status: become labels.\n",
    "4. [GetUserStatsForGame](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetUserStatsForGame_.28v0002.29)\n",
    "    - returns a list of hundreds of statistics on player's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labeling Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main problems with using VAC ban status as the label:\n",
    "1. A player can be banned at other games beside CS:GO. This remains one of the biggest flaw\n",
    "but this is the best label we can do given no internal data from Valve. However, CS:GO is the\n",
    "most played on steam for many years by a large margin. It is also the most vulnerable to cheat programs\n",
    "which increase the probability that a player is VAC banned from CS:GO. The second most played\n",
    "game is Dota 2 which limits the possibilities of cheats due to almost everything being server side.\n",
    "2. Cheaters can manually adjusting their program so they can appear innocent. If they are\n",
    "clever enough in the settings, it is impossible to detect them without identity which programs\n",
    "enable they hack in the background (which is not data science).\n",
    "3. VAC ban status is not 100% reliable. There are many cases of wrongly banned accounts and\n",
    "there are many cheaters' accounts are not banned. But Valve has improved VAC significantly\n",
    "in the last decade which saw a conviction rate of up to 80-90% True positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The API can returns over 250 features for each user in CS:GO. This means that\n",
    "some thoughtful cleaning must be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: accuracy_pistol = total_hit_pistol/total_shot_pistol\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply ML and deep learning\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a classification problem, outputs in the form of probability is more\n",
    "useful here for a practical reason: threshold for cheater label can be manually adjusted.\n",
    "This is extremely useful to solve the label uncertainty issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: Banning a non cheater is much worse than not banning a cheater in this case.\n",
    "Thus, False Positive rate must be very low for the model to be considered successful.\n",
    "If the probability is high, manual review of the player is recommended.\n",
